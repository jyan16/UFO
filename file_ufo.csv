They were looking at the night sky and commenting on how pretty it was because it was so clear and they could see so many stars.  It was then that they saw a bright glowing object that was moving in an odd way.  They continued to stare at it and realized that it definitely wasn\\'t a star.  It also was not a plane. It looked like it was changing shape slightly and it would get very bright, then start to dim and they could also see the faint changes in color.<BR><BR>She ran into the house to grab my camera. I have an expensive Canon camera that will zoom in 80x. It also takes video.  When she zoomed in and started the video, she could not believe what she was seeing.  And neither could I.  I am still stunned as I type this. It\\'s so hard to describe without you seeing it (we are trying to figure out how to download it from the camera and upload onto YouTube), but the circular light would start to flash colors that weren\\'t visible to the naked eye... you could only see it through the camera lense when it was magnified. It would flash colors and then look like it explodes - or radiates out - dissipates and then forms back into a bright circular light.  Almost like some sort of strange emanating force-field or something.  It would also move straight up, back down, to the right, the left, etc.  It\\'s the most amazing and strangest thing I\\'ve ever seen in my life.  She caught several of them on camera last night.<BR><BR>She and our other friend started looking early this morning online to see if there were other sightings and they only found one mention... oddly enough, it was happening at the same exact time they made their first sighting.  The videos are posted on YouTube from a family in Washington state.  You can clearly hear how shocked they were to be seeing what they were seeing.  I think they were taking their video from a cell phone and couldn\\'t zoom in nearly as close as we could, so you could see the same type of circular bright light, some of the faint colors, and see it moving, but you couldn\\'t see that weird emanating force-field thing that we experienced.  But, other than that, it looked like the same type of thing we were witnessing.  This couple (and their child) were seeing the same thing at the same time in Washington that we were experiencing right here in New Jersey.<BR><BR>I swear to you this is a not a joke and we have something really incredible on video tape. We need to figure out a way to get it to you... and we also wanted to ask if you knew of any reputable places that could analyze it.  We hesitate to send it to NASA after our research today - especially since apparently last night, they cut their live satellite feed when six unidentified objects flew past it.  So, why would they cut the feed? This is all just too strange. And, like I said, I know it sounds crazy.  But, I know I\\'m not crazy. I know what I\\'m seeing on my own camera and I know what my best friend is telling me that she saw with her own eyes and I believe her.  Our friend who was over works for the Department of Agriculture for the State of NJ and he couldn\\'t believe his eyes either.  He had never seen anything like it in his entire life and said that he\\'s going to be researching it today with whoever will listen to him and talk to him about it.<BR><BR>All I know is that we saw something.... something that definitely is NOT from this Earth, I can guarantee you that.</FONT></TD>"""

I used the guide of a tree to verify it wasnt moving. Tonight, my neighbor told my husband to come out side and look at this object tonthe South of our house. I noticed it was the same appearance as what I saw Friday night. My neighbor though it was something doing surveillance. It doeant look like a star and it appears to be a bright light..or several bright lights in a row to make one. It is 10:10 PM as I type this and I have been recording it for over an hour. It moves similar to a flash light being waved spraticly in the dark and then it fizzles away and disappears...only to reappear a second later. I wish I could notify someone to docuement this better than I can...as I am using a LG Stylo 2 cell phone and have made numerous vidios over the past hour. By my naked eye, I can barely tell its moving, and it doesnt appear by naked eye to move a grea! t distance; but with my cell recording it, I am able to see it moving extremely fast sparaticly, actually disappearing only to reappear similar to a light splat. I emailed my local news to tell them what I am seeing and asked if they would also record it because thry might possibly be able to get better footage with a professional, high grade camera versus a LG cell phone. I have never ever experienced anything like this...and wasnt a believer in UFO\\'s. Ironically, my 8 year old son has been watching u_ _ _ _ videos on UFO\\'s and has been terrified to go to sleep the last few nights and I just finished telling him they dont exist...and if they did...they sure wouldn\\'t come to Memphis where it\\'s so populated and so much crime....I joked and alian would grt shot here..lol. This is unbelievably the most interesting thing I have ever seen. If anyone would like to see the footage I have, I\\'ll gladly post or send it. I am going to keep recording it every night while it\\'s here. I a! m 8 months pregnant and have to be up and at work in the morni! ng. I wi ll do one more recording before I go to bed. I wish someone could point me in the right direction of someone local to confirm this sighting! Anyone in my area of South Memphis...specifically Whitehaven, a half mile from the Mississippi border looking South.

Because it was in the western sky, some people will think &quot;oh, Venus&quot; - fine.  I\\'m not an astronomer, but I\\'ve spent many a starry, planety night gazing at this sky from my hot tub, and have never seen anything like this.  <BR><BR>Tonight I had just stepped out onto my back deck, and this brilliant &quot;fire in the sky&quot; caught my eye, so I paused to watch it.  It was higher than local planes fly, but seemingly lower than the cruising altitude of a international jet.  It was moving slowly in the way that satellites do ... I always have fun looking for satellites in the sky because they\\'re more-common to spot than shooting stars.  But this was lower than a satellite.  It was BRIGHT ... so bright that it almost hurt my eyes to look directly at it, but it was so fascinating that I made myself look anyway.  The color of the object itself was yellow-orange, nearly exactly like fire, but the light coming from it towards the earth was a white light, which did not seem to be &quot;panning&quot; or searching ... it just seemed to be emanating.  There was no flickering or blinking. In addition, there were a few shafts of brilliant blue-green light coming from behind it as the object slowly travelled toward me (from west to east).  These almost neon blue-green rays were nearly obscured by the bright orange body of the object itself, but were colore! d so intensely that if you stared at it, you could clearly see them.  If one were to speculate, one might think that they would appear as they did if they were part of a propulsion system.<BR><BR> The object made no sound.  It was fairly high in the sky, at about 65 degrees.  Its path of direction was not constant, as a standard satellite\\'s would be.  It slowly tracked closer to my home (a rural area, with few houses), then it seemed to stabilize its location.  I went inside to do some internet searching of such phenomena, looked out the window about 10 minutes later and it seemed a bit further away to the west, and about a half hour after my initial sighting, I looked, and it was gone.  (And at that time, I also noted Venus in the sky, looking much further-away and much like a planet, like it always does.)  I am not so informed as to discount the possibility of extra-terrestrial visitors, but it seems much more likely to me that such an object could be military / government in origin. There are military bases within 50-100 miles to the south and east of me.</FONT></TD>"""

I was sitting on one of the chairs facing East looking out the living room window that also faces East, and while my nephew was commenting on a topic we were discussing, I saw what I can only describe as this:  &#8220;Two oval-shaped lights, BRIGHT, sparkling,&#8221; appeared over the treetop of a neighbor&#8217;s home.<BR><BR>The only lighting from outdoors came from two homes, which I could see from my position.  These two porch lights and one dull, street light were the only noticeable light sources.<BR><BR>I stared in puzzlement with what I was seeing, and the flurry of possibilities came flooding into my mind of what I was seeing:  &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s the traffic lights from the neighborhoods in the hills&#8230;but that can&#8217;t be because there&#8217;s no lights or traffic lights coming from that direction. It&#8217;s a big rig&#8230;wait, that&#8217;s too close and too big to be that low and that big.  Street lights?  No.  That&#8217;s not a street light.&#8221;  These are the thoughts that were racing in my mind as I watched these &#8220;lights&#8221; float and lower to the level of the neighbor&#8217;s rooftop and then disappear.<BR><BR>I stared, after it disappeared, trying to figure out what I had just seen.  The first words out of my mouth after the &#8220;lights&#8221; disappeared, was, &#8220;Oh. My. Gosh.&#8221;  Not wanting to create fear with my nephew, I waited until he was finished with his conversation and slowly introduced him into what I had just witnessed.  His response was doing the &#8220;Sign of the Cross,&#8221; and uttering a quick prayer.  I laughed reassuring  him that there was no need to be concerned because I wasn&#8217;t afraid.  I said to my nephew, &#8220;I KNOW what I saw.  I saw it. I just don&#8217;t know WHAT I saw. What the HELL did I just see?&#8221;  This incident lasted about 2-3 seconds, but DAMN, I can&#8217;t get it out of my head and I am not about to go broadcasting it publicly because who&#8217;s going to believe a random sighting of unexplainable lights amidst skeptics? Well, there you have it.  I would NEVER put myself into a position of being persecuted for perjury.  I KNOW what I saw, I can&#8217;t explain WHAT it was, but I KNOW what I saw.  Please help me to explain this because it&#8217;s constantly replaying in my mind.<BR><BR>THANK YOU for your time to look into this and hopefully explain it.

The light lasted only about two seconds.  It was very bright but, hazy/fuzzy on the edges, but that could have been due to clouds.  It was oval shaped and from my perspective about an inch big up in the sky (not sure how to explain it), it was almost as big as when you look at the moon.  I saw it for only the two seconds and it disappeared, not like an airplane flying and the light was too big for an airplane.  I would guess it was only about 2 miles up in the sky and going left to right.  It was the south west moving north west at a slight degree upward.  It was not like fireworks.   It was just a bright aqua light.  I jumped from my chair to look closer and it was gone.  The light just stopped, it didn\\'t burn out or fly away and get smaller.

At times a flash of light in the shape of a crescent would come from it..my Mother saw this too, and it would stay in one area then zoom quickly to the other part of the sky.  Well tonight I saw it again and it is still out there doing this.  It doesn\\'t stop.  It was all over the place doing the same things as before but this time it emitted 3 white dot like lights-best way to describe is like the flash when you take a picture-it did this twice then it for a second was shrouded by blackness (there were NO clouds)and came back out.  I followed it with my eyes as it joined (I couldn\\'t believe this) what looked like 3 more faint amber lights..they like danced around each other.  Then that one took off again just zooming and zig zagging around the stars.  It would pause at times then take off in a quickness then zig zag around.  I found myself not even wanting to blink so I could keep up with it. I could stay out there all night watching it. Very mesmerized and perplexed.  I live out in the country and there are no city lights around.  I don\\'t know what this is or what is going on but something is definitely happening up there.</FONT></TD>"""

These bright lights were spaced evenly at a considerable amount of distance from the next.  All seven lights moved in perfect unison and were traveling in a perfectly straight line.  This, as well as, a quiet but definite low hum that indicated an overpassing aircraft could be heard as it passed.  This hum from the craft was an echoing sound and gave the impression that this craft was very big.  Possibly 1/4 to 1/2 mile long suspecting these numerous lights made one large combined craft.  This was not the first time I have spotted this craft. About two weeks ago on this day in the same direction, traveling the same way, I and four other witnesses sighted this craft moving at a slightly faster rate.  About one hour later of that same night, in the direction of which the earlier craft had moved out of eyesight, an extremely bright and large emission of an orange fireball erupted through the sky moving horizontally in the sky north to south with an orange trail traveling behind.  The fireball dissipated within 4 seconds.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))</FONT></TD>'"

I looked over at a small softball park that behind our property, it is closed for the winter.  I saw close to the ground a red glowing orb.  I thought at first it was someone with a dim flashlight, but then it appeared to flicker out like a flame.  Then reappeared, and then disappeared again.  I can\\'t pinpoint exactly where it was, since I was looking across several acres, and trees.  No one else saw this.<BR><BR>Wednesday February 14, 2017, we were again walking out to retrieve our horses.  this was around 7:30 PM.  My husband said something and stopped.. I stopped and backed up to see, a cluster of these glowing red almost rectangular in shape lights, that were up in the air, through the trees.  There were at least 7 lights, that randomly came on and off, and would reappear in other locations. These lights appeared to be dripping something.  It appeared as if there were burning embers dropping from these lights.<BR><BR>Also amongst these, were white sparkly lights, that would come on and go off randomly.  We had a helper who ran out of the barn, to see what we were seeing, and he too witnessed the lights.  I then thought to take out my phone and record, and I did get a small white dot, that came on and off, but it is hard to see much from it.    A 4th person came out of the barn and also witnessed some of the lights.  By this time they were drifting north and getting further way, and all we saw at this point was the white sparkly ones.  We watched until they disappeared.<BR><BR>Thursday February 15th, 2017,  this night we did not have to bring the horses in, as they stayed in most the day, but we did decide to go out and see if we could see the lights again. This was at 7:00 PM.  We saw them immediately in the same area.  Same red glowing lights, that soon went out. We ran toward the back of our property to get beyond the trees, and were treated to many white sparkly lights, and clusters of pulsating white lights, that we thought at first were airplanes.  However, I mentioned that there were too many, too close together to be airplanes, and they were not traveling, they were staying stationary.  Then we saw for just an instant, a row of red round lights, that lit up one at a time, till a row was visible, and then they went out just as they lit up.  3 of us witnessed this.  By this time the white strobes slowly drifted north again, leaving one loan red orb, hovering over the trees.  This was very far off, but we could see it.  It would move left the! n right, go up a ways.. over, and then back down. This stayed for at least 10 minutes.   My husband saw one that was a small solid light (silver/white), that he thought at first was a satellite, till it came to a complete stop.  It sat stationary for about 10 seconds, then it moved straight down, stopped again, was shining for a minute or two then went out.  We watched all this take place over about 15 to 20 minutes.  By this time we were cold, and decided to go in.<BR><BR>We have called a friend with good cameras, to come tonight to see if we can see them again.</FONT></TD>"""

I couldn\\'t see anything but looked for some point of reference and noticed an airliner taking off from LAX (it was climbing) some 10.7 miles away north west from our location at mother\\'s in Torrance Ca.<BR><BR>I asked him if he could see the jet and he said no but would go to the front yard to get an unobstructed view.  While he was moving from the back yard to the front I could see a flash that lasted about one second.<BR><BR>The flash was about 60% the size of a full moon.  This object flashed three times and at three second intervals, and on the third flash I could see what appeared to be a star but in full daylight as it was a very bright white light.<BR><BR>I then noticed a pinkish orange flash coming from the star object at three second intervals. My son came back on the phone and said it was on a collision course with the airliner which he could now see.<BR><BR>The star object would flash for a second coast for three seconds and then flash again for a second.  At this point my eyes were adjusted and I could see a second identical object trailing the first.  It was also flashing pinkish orange but at two second intervals until it caught up with the first object.<BR><BR>The scene left me with the impression it was dropping down from a higher altitude to a lower one.  The second star craft was as it was dropping down reminded me of a shooting flare much like a descending flare from a flare gun except it was bright white.<BR><BR>When the two objects were even they both were flashing in complete unison as if they were mirror images of each other.  They were perfectly side by side and were headed from the northwest towards the southeast.  They gave me the impression like, they were skipping across the sky.  Like an ice skater, rhythmic and smooth.<BR><BR>I told my son I could see two objects and they were headed towards me.  I looked at my watch and it was 15:50 and told my son to go to work because the incident distracted him from going to work.  He was suppose to be at work at 16:00 and he hung up the phone and went to work.<BR><BR>The airliner was headed perfectly due east and I could see the airliner and star objects converge.  I almost expected a collision but the star objects were well above the airliner because one of the star objects was blotted out by the mass of the jet but for only a split second.<BR><BR>Just when I thought it couldn\\'t get any better a third object appeared as if it just dropped in on the other two objects.  The third object dropped in on the other two exactly like the second star object.<BR><BR>I expected the third Starcraft to line up with the other two but it did not, it went into what I think was a kind of missing man formation.  It hung slightly back of the other two and at a distance double the distance of the first two objects.<BR><BR>Had there been a fourth object lined up with the other three they would have been perfectly spaced.  Like this.  *   *   *   *  except the far right third object was slightly behind like this.          &#8226;  &#8226;         *  Size and Distance if a circle is 360 degrees and from horizon is 180 degrees then the the two objects were about 5 degrees apart and the third object at 10 degree and slightly back.<BR><BR>My son sighted the first object at 15:40 I caught site of the first one at roughly 15:48 by 15:50 my son left for work he said he seen two and missed the third possibly because by 15:48 they were closer to me than him.<BR><BR>The third object went back up and disappeared while the two continued southeast until I lost sight of them at about 15:55 due to the distance. They were almost directly over head and my neck is sore form looking up so long.<BR><BR>They seemed too slow as by my estimation if you could have seen them from horizon to horizon it would have taken them 30 minutes to make that distance. Between my son and I we watched them for 15 minutes.<BR><BR>Thank you for your work.</FONT></TD>"""

They moved like fighter jets changing formation darting around then getting back into various formations. because of how high they are and large about the size of airplanes I knew they were not normal, I knew I needed to record them.<BR><BR>At the beginning of the video, they look very far away and tiny. It\\'s unfortunate that smartphone cameras make things that are about the distance of an airplane look much tinier than they are because to the human eye these UFO\\'s were much closer like looking up at an airplane flying over at about 2,000-3,000 feet.<BR><BR>It was also clear these things were metallic as they were very reflective and would get easier to see as they maneuvered and changed direction in the sky.<BR><BR>I zoomed in but because of how bright the sun was it was hard to see my screen which is why I loose them in conjunction with how fast they were moving across the sky.<BR><BR>Lastly, I know it may lose some credibility because I put my product logos on the video but I have a family to support so I had to capitalize on this unique and puzzling experience with my kids.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be extremely credible.

It is difficult to estimate the height and location of the object, but I estimate it was centered over Winter Springs, Florida at a height that was a little higher than you would typically see a helicopter.  The object was likely Frisbee shaped, but I believe I was just seeing it from the side which I would describe as Cigar shaped.  My first thought was that it was a drone, but it was moving too quickly and effortlessly.  It went from the original location to the left and hovered, then to the right and hovered, and then up higher to hover.  The changes in location were split second, not gradual changes.  The object seemed to be lit up with a white light that covered its entire shape.  Based on how white the light was and that it didn&#8217;t seem like a glare, my guess is that it was a light coming from the object and not the sun&#8217;s reflection.  I was able to track the minor movemen! ts for about a minute before the object proceeded East at a speed that disappeared from view within a moment.  It is a sunny day here with some clouds in the sky, but no weather conditions can explain what I saw.  This is my first time in seeing something like this, and I want to know if anyone else has seen this object in my area.<BR><BR></FONT></TD>'"

I was getting up to get some honey for my sore throat.  I noticed that the moon was very bright, however very few stars actually visible in the night sky.  We are accustomed to seeing planes come in from the direction I was looking.  What caught my eye was that it did not appear to be moving and rather than the traditional, well timed flash of lights on the wing of a plane, these were multi coloured and extremely bright lights. And rather than the lights appearing to be on the object, the lights seemed to be the object and around the object all at the same time.  The other anomaly was that it was not moving.  I lined it up with a street light on the other side of the city and stood stationary and it never moved.  The tree line was also visible in the dark and it was not going up or down either.  We keep binoculars in the kitchen window for bird watching so I steadied my arms by resting them on the counter and looked through.  Plane shapes are easily seen this way.  This was not holding a specific shape and seemed to change randomly in a fluid manner.<BR><BR>I woke up my house mate and the first suggestion was that it may be Sirius which most certainly can have bright flashing colours.  Although we have never seen Sirius that low in the sky. The other thing that was strange was that it looked considerably bigger than a star in the sky.  Taking into consideration there were only two other stars visible in the clear view of the sky from the kitchen window, it was strange enough to keep watching.<BR><BR>After approximately another five minutes of watching it, the object slowly moved away in the direction of South West fairly fast until it appeared to be lowering in the sky to the tree line.  It was definitely moving away rather than dropping because it was getting smaller and harder to see.<BR><BR>Taking the distance from the object, night time hours, treeline and buildings into consideration, I would estimate the overall size (although fluidly changing) to be that of five to six city buses, end to end, wide.  And perhaps four city buses, end to end, high.<BR><BR>We both had the sensation of feeling unnerved.  I can only describe it as feeling like we were seeing something that was not right.  Even when we trying to rationalize that it was a star or something else.  It was a little upsetting and exciting at the same time.  Just a knowing that something was, off?  Hard to put my finger on it.<BR><BR>I do not need to be contacted by anyone, however if anyone has questions I am happy to  answer them.</FONT></TD>'"

I made the trip there with nothing abnormal, began the trip home and seem to have lost some time.  <BR><BR>After making a left turn onto NC RT49 in Roxboro, NC, heading back to my home about 9 miles away, I remember seeing a section of the road where after the left turn, the road has 4 lanes.  About a mile or two after that the road narrows to 2 lanes and its around another 8 miles to my house.  I moved here about 3 years ago, so I am usually looking around at landmarks, way points, or familiar sights to keep me aware of where I am.  <BR><BR>During this trip home I remember the part where the road changes to two lanes, but have no memory of what I saw during the trip home until I looked up, saw lights in the sky above me, and realized I had driven passed the road my house in on, and driven another 8 miles or so.  I onl! y remember seeing the lights above the road, and had to sort of hunch down in the seat to see them above the road.  <BR><BR>At that point, I realized where I was, looked at the clock and it was 7:28PM.  I thought maybe I had fallen asleep, but the road has some curves-twists that could not be navigated without some sort of intelligent control.  I have no idea what happened, but thought I needed to tell someone about it.<BR><BR> Thanks, Scott Horner</FONT></TD>'"

No sound, then flickers out to the west of city.<BR><BR>I was in my back yard on the 8th of Feb. 2017.  I do amature astronomy and am outside many nights. I saw what I thought was an airplane at first coming from the south east.  As it came closer I noticed it had no blinking lights. It was just one very bright red light.  It was so different than anything I have ever seen that I called for my wife to come out to see what she thought.  She was also puzzled as to what it could be.  <BR><BR>It proceeded to fly overhead just south of our location and toward the west.  While it was in the western sky at about 40 degrees over the horizon the light sputtered off and on about 4 times, in about an 8 to 10 seconds period then went completely out.  There was no sound coming from the light and the sly was clear, no clouds and an almost full moon.  <BR><BR>I would very much like to know what could cause such a light.  I have ruled out stars, airplanes, helicopters, satellites, space station and satellite flares.  Even ruled out a rocket since I don\\'t! believe rocket launches go over Tucson.  <BR><BR>It traveled several miles across the sky so it was not a civilian drone.

It would move left, right, up, and down.  Also, it seems to change shape, but I am unsure whether or not it has a definitive shape or if it could be inter-dimensional.  It seems to shift from a ball of light to a triangular and/ or star-like shape and back.  It is most certainly moving back and forth so I know it is not a satellite or a plane as those move continuously in one direction.  We used a scope to magnify it and another object my father saw moving near the moon.  The initial object was very bright and noticeable and was very clearly moving in multiple directions, but it never shot off or disappeared.  When magnified the second object would appear to have a worm like structure and then it would shift back into a ball of light.  It was moving as well.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.

Flagler Beach.<BR><BR>I was on South Flagler Avenue by the Flagler beach police station in my vehicle, it was night time and it was approx. 18:40 hours.  An extremely large black triangular object approached from the South West at approx 5-10mph and was approx 1.5 miles away from my location.  I slowed the vehicle to idle to witness the object.  The object appeared approx 2,500- 4,000 feet in the atmosphere at that time.  At first sight, it appeared that the object was not on a horizontal plane.  It appeared to be on more of a vertical plane.  Upon first sight of this object i noticed 3 lights; they appeared similar to butterscotch in color.  The object remained moving towards my location at 5-10mph.  I noticed a vehicle in front of me heading north on Flagler avenue that had stopped to take pictures of the object.  I brought my vehicle to a complete stop and got out of the vehicle and I continued taking photos with my Galaxy Note smart phone. The vehicle behind me heading south, pulled! over on to the right hand side of the road.  The driver got out of the vehicle and appeared to be using a video camera (not a smart phone) and was capturing the object on video.  The left side of the object passed directly above my head at what appeared to be 500-1000ft directly overhead.  At that time, the object appeared to be approx. 500 feet in width and length and on a horizontal plane.  Upon looking up I saw 3 lights that were visible, the lights were on each of the 3 points.  The lights were recessed and cylindrical and did not have an aura.  The light on the north east side, front forward moving, and the North West side, front forward moving were bright white.  The light on the back side of the object or the Southside was blue.  Directly underneath the object, in between the North West side white light and the South side blue light were approx. 15-20 spherical shape impressions on the underside of the object.  The object was dark and the only reason I could tell it was tri! angular was because of the 3 lights, the 15-20 spherical shape! impress ions running in between the two lights.  The object made no sound, no vibration and no other auditory sensory. The object appeared to keep moving at the same 5-10 mph and towards the north east. It did not change speed, vanish, dematerialize or change in any immediate direction; velocity remained the same with no immediate changes.  Because I had stopped in the middle of the road and got out of my vehicle, due to oncoming traffic, I needed to get back into my vehicle as to not stop up traffic.  I dropped my phone, picked up the pieces, got in my car and continued heading south on S. Flagler Avenue.  I could see the object during my drive down S Flagler Avenue.  I came to the 7th street stop sign and went east at which that point I lost sight of the object.  I have spent many years at Whiteman Airforce base and have witnessed many B2 Stealth Bombers up close, directly overhead, on take off and on landing.  They have a distinct sound and have a distinct design.  This object was double or triple the size of a B2 Stealth and was definitely NOT a B2 and was NOT any aircraft I have ever seen.  I have photos and if you have photos you can share please send to ((address deleted))@bellsouth.net.  I will also share what I have.</FONT></TD>'"

There were no other unusual sounds sights or behaviors witnessed in the city.<BR><BR>Night is also considered significant in unknown way as I had a very, very, very! detailed dream some years ago of the wedding chapel interior, including seeing in detail several items, despite never seeing them before.<BR><BR>The wedding was of the child of a friend of a family member, so it held no personal significance and was not noteworthy outside of the green beans, which were good.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It seems to be some type of orange fire ball that sometimes is only 1 ball and then others up to 6.  The object would only light up for a min then fade away without any noise at all.  At first I thought it could have been a flare until it reappeared with  2 , 4 or 6 of the same shape and color objects and the objects have showed up like clock work every afternoon just as the sun is going down and always in the same general area but were obviously not planes or anything I\\'ve  ever seen and where I live is near two airports one is only a few miles away so I know what an aircraft looks like and where they were wasn\\'t in the direction as the airport.  Now the first day it caught my eye because there were 4 of them and they all had long tails moving out to the side of it before disappearing.  Tonight After the craft had flickered out the last time a helicopte! r showed up and circled the area for about 30 minutes before it took off over the gulf and never returned. I have seen other craft almost as amazing as this one in the same general area of the sky within the last 6 months also but they were red and blue flickering lights and then shot up into the sky like a bullet.  Before I go I don\\'t know if it means anything although I think its strange but each time I have seen these objects I just seem to find myself going outside for no reason it almost feels as though I am being called outside and the second night I saw these things I went to bed and none of my dogs would come to bed (we all sleep in the same room) about two hours after I saw it I woke up with this strange beeping noise in my room and I sat up to see this strange green and red light in a human like shape floating off the ground and about 4 foot tall and then it vanished. I laid back down feeling strange and then I felt my bed sink in rite in the middle of the bed and ! I got a strange and terrified feeling then I felt like I passe! d out , but I don\\'t know if I did or not. Then I saw these flashes in my head of these weird looking kids with big eyes and blond almost white hair that looked like it was falling out or something. This is really bothering me I have never had anything like this happen before so I would really like to find out what in the Hell was I looking at! I tried to take video its really crappy but I am sure I got at least 1 still shot</FONT></TD>"""

We were seated outside, and near the end of our meal, I glanced around the sky.  It was such a beautiful and clear Southern California day, especially after the recent storms in the area.  While looking around, I noticed a twinkling white light to the north, about the same height in the sky as the top of a street light pole on Ventura Blvd from where we were seated. I first thought that it was a very bright and early star, but the twinkling was too bright to the naked eye, and I immediately observed very slow movement.  My next thought was a potential satellite sighting, but no straight flight path existed &#8212; movement was somewhat erratic, though slow at times.  This was easily confirmed due to the light&#8217;s position just to the right of the street light pole, which allowed me a point of reference in the sky.<BR><BR>The light was far too high, to my observation, to be commercial aircraft (best guess was 150,000ft or more) &#8212; it was too erratic and slow for a satellite path, and it also didn&#8217;t appear to be any type of rocket (to my knowledge) due to it&#8217;s start-stop movement.  The emitting of light (or glinting of sunlight off of the object, which was another thought) also had no pattern and seemed to be random, almost as if the object was spinning about &#8212; at times it became so dim to the point that I&#8217;d thought it disappeared, then it would randomly shine bright seconds later, as bright as a star in the early evening or early morning sky.  The level of brightness was observed changing drastically without obstruction as the light slowly pinged about the clear blue sky.<BR><BR>A second white light holding the same characteristics was also observed momentarily, further up in the sky and to the left of the first light I fixated upon.  To confirm, my wife and I both observed these objects and all of the mentioned movements/lights.  The only further detail I observed on the main light was the emission of tiny, nearly invisible, red lights &#8212; these seemed to be ejected from the object and quickly disappeared into the blue of the sky.

It felt as though the light was watching me and I was watching it. I shut my blinds and continued to watch the light through them.  Suddenly 2 more beach ball sized lights appeared.  One was positioned about 75 feet away from the first light, but hung at the same level.  The second was about 100 feet over to the right, and hung lower than the other two.  I called down to my husband, and joined him a! t the window on the first floor of our home.

As a smoker, he is outside rather frequently.  I dropped the late night dishes I was working on and hurried to the back door assuming he had spotted an owl.  He pointed at the sky and said, &#8220;WHAT is THAT?&#8221;  Frankly, I started to say helicopter but I got this out, &#8220;heli&#8230;&#8221; as I took in the sight and realized how large, how bright, how pulsing, and how it was NOT moving like a helicopter.  Furthermore, helicopters don&#8217;t use shockingly green, pulsing lights.<BR><BR> The very bright, and I mean bright, neon-electric green blob shot in 90-degree angles multiple times where I heard myself blurt, &#8220;What IS that?&#8221;  Just like my boyfriend had done.  It gave me the impression it was darting from place to place like it had not prepared a logical route and had to backtrack frequently.  I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not true but that is exactly what went through my logical, planning mind.  I would plot a course and have a plan of action, not dart and backtrack all over town if I was trying to accomplish something.<BR><BR>It flashed, I really should say pulsed, this green light but it wasn&#8217;t logical pulsing like an aircraft does.  I live near a very small, businessman&#8217;s style airport, RL Jones in Jenks, OK and having lived here about 15 years, I know what the airplanes coming and going look like and what they do night and day.  Additionally, my former step-father of 10 years was a pilot for American Airlines and I&#8217;ve been in his open-cockpit airplane, a private jet he flew and have detailed experience being in and around aircraft.  This was NOT an airplane.<BR><BR>This thing was brighter than anything in the sky.  If I had to compare its brightness to something I would go with something in Las Vegas.  One of their casinos.  That bright.  Bright enough that when my boyfriend pointed it out, I didn&#8217;t have scan the horizon and search or squint.  My eyes snapped right to this green flashing light.<BR><BR>It made no sound I could hear.  The pulsing lights it had would flash very quickly but not in any discernable pattern, and then turn off for a split second.  When the lights would return, all but once it would have moved a decent distance.  At one point it shot so far away, it became a pinpoint of green light, but then it immediately shot back to where it had been.<BR><BR>Like I said, this pulsing, vibrant light had no logical sequence of illumination I could detect and I got the visual feeling that the lights were rolling upward, sideways and down to create the undulating, pulsing type light I was witnessing.<BR><BR>Right as my boyfriend returned with his phone to try and record this thing, the light went out for about 1 second.  It illuminated again still in the same spot, and then the object moved a great linear distance over the rooftops in my field of vision.  It was gone in a second.  1 single second after traversing what is visually to me at least two miles.  Probably more like three as we sit on a bit of rolling hill and can see very far from our vantage point.  It disappeared after it made that long, inexplicable stretch.<BR><BR>The trajectory it took generally takes the airplanes I see a couple of minutes to cross.  I watch airplanes take the similar route daily and I can watch them for minutes.  This was a singular second.  I have to assume this object was large to be where it was and so visible, because typically those aircraft are 747&#8217;s when they are at that altitude, or much lower and loud if leaving RL Jones and obvious.  I can see airplanes from both airports from where my house sits.  This thing was markedly brighter, like incomparably bright.<BR><BR>You might be tempted to assume it was a Friday night and we were drinking.  First, I&#8217;m 48-years-old and so is my boyfriend.  Secondly, he just got out of the hospital with diverticulitis.  One of his antibiotics he must take is alternatively used to help people quit drinking and will cause vicious migraine headaches if the patient attempts to drink.  The pharmacist heavily warned him not to dare drink anything alcoholic while taking this antibiotic, so not only was he not drinking, I wasn&#8217;t.  We don&#8217;t take drugs, either.  Neither of us has mental disorders of any sort, nor would be so insane as to take time out of our day to write a fake report.<BR><BR>I actually was very unnerved.  I said prayers, to be frank, for a good while before I went to bed about 30 minutes later.  I didn&#8217;t get a happy E.T. feeling.  I got a hair-raising, yuck, I-don&#8217;t-like-that-thing feeling.  I&#8217;m not a fearful person.  Yet, my arm hair stood on end several minutes after coming back inside the house.<BR><BR>It was a clear night.  No clouds, no weather, if that matters.<BR><BR>Anyway, thank you for letting me report this.  I actually came to this site to check your information hoping someone else saw this.  With the hills we live atop I shouldn&#8217;t have been one of two people to see it.  It was over the Arkansas River a good while, so I assume people on Riverside Drive on the east side of the river, (I&#8217;m on the west side of this river) which is still Jenks, could see it.  As far as it darted it also spent some time (seconds that I saw, no more) over south Tulsa, and when it took its pinprick size, long distant jaunt for that second, I would say it was over Glenpool but it went so far it may have crossed into another small suberb. (I&#8217;m on the Jenks/Glenpool border.)  Thanks again.</FONT></TD>'"

My class and I were outside doing a couple laps on the school track after lunch.  The sky was clear and a couple planes were going by.  I glanced up and was looking at the long trail produced out the back of one of the planes, when I noticed what looked like a very bright star in the east by southeast portion of the sky.  It appeared to be above the 33,000 foot cruising altitude and was slightly bigger than the planes which were flying their typical daily routes.  It just stayed in one place.  I pointed it out to my kids because we had never seen  a stationary star in the daylight before.  The rest of my class gathered around us and we all stopped and watched it.  It seemed to slowly shift and elongate.  In other words--it went from a star to a white cylinder shape, and then back to a star as if it was maybe rotating like a baton.  It would remain a star and only occasionally switch to the cylinder only a few times (3x).  A couple times it completely disappeared, then would reappear in the same place.  It moved very slowly to the center of the sky at a barely legible speed over the course of 15 minutes, and then completely disappeared.  My class was excited and freaking out to each other.  None of them were scared whatsoever, and in fact seemed very elated.  There was no noise detected from the object, although we cannot hear jets at that altitude either..<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the video, and the white light looks to us to be Venus.

Every night I hear an airplane like turbulence noise.  Usually I think nothing of it, but this morning the noise sounded so close that it caused my bed and walls to move and my ears feel like they would pop.  The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.  Then moves back North and stays.  It starts to flash a light towards the ground. It does that twice, almost like in a circle.  Then the third time it flashes at my window.  I freak out and decide to go back to bed (my cat in my bed also was scared. She started to meow weirdly, like she does when begging for water, but she didn&#8217;t move to drink). I&#8217;m not sure when the light stopped shining because I fell asleep.  I didn\\'t want to tell anyone, because I thought maybe it was a helicopter possibly looking for someo! ne.  Then in the morning my four year old sister, getting ready for school, tells my mom that someone was knocking on the window last night and she was scared to leave her bed to wake my mom.  My mom thinks nothing of it.  I show my mom the video and she tells me what my little sister told her.  <BR><BR>At first I thought maybe it was me she heard because I was by the window to film.  When my sister leaves school, I ask her a few questions (I Obviously didnt tell her that it may be aliens because she would never sleep again).  We ask if it was a bang or a knock.  She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.  My mom then asked if she saw anything, and she said she saw a person with no hair.  I asked if it was fat and she said no, that he was very skinny.  I don&#8217;t know how reliable a four year olds word is, but I got chills.</FONT></TD>"""

What made me start looking on the internet to see if anyone else had reported anything was because a day or so later, up until last week, we had tons of military chopper activity going back and forth. We are close to DC and a couple of military bases so we get training ops flying overhead every once in a while. But not usually this much activity.</FONT></TD>"""

He climbed back into the seat.  I pointed at it and said, &#8220;Is that what I think it is?&#8221;  He was quiet and just looking then said, &#8220;Look at these coming in.&#8221;   Four circular, hazy, orange, orbs came up to the left of the bright &#8220;star.&#8221;  The orbs went from a straight line to a chevron form two or three times before noticing there was more orange orbs coming from behind us.  <BR><BR>The bright star moved closer but stayed just below the tree line, looked like when the star blinked the orbs changed formation.  When number 8-9 orbs showed up I was too nervous to stay any longer, but never got the feeling of being threatened.  We were able to see them until very close to 287 and just before town there was a very large plane/shuttle that crossed from our right to our left at a fairly slow speed for a &#8220;plane.&#8221;  The back of it had red and green lights on the back of it.

It was a clear night with no clouds, stars were visible.  I was the only witness who saw this.

As the chevron passed over head, it started accelerating and gaining altitude, before the lights disappeared 40 to 50 degrees above the horizon looking north.  The lights were observed for a total of 100 to 120 degrees in the sky.  As the lights passed from south to north, they changed shape from a chevron into a straight line.  I live on a N-S-E-W street grid, and I can determine that the lights were traveling within 10 degrees of the N-S axis.<BR><BR>From the observation point, the lights appeared relatively small, but much larger than a star.  The individual lights were round, with a hazy edge and appeared to be about 1/6 the size of the moon.  The chevron formation had a span of 3 moons, and stayed approximately this size for the entire duration, as they changed shape.  As the object passed overhead, it made no sounds.  The dog I was letting out did not respond to the event.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be eloquent, and sober-minded.

He called me over and pointed toward the object he was watching and my eyes immediately fixated on it.  The object was very high in the sky and I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport so I know most aircrafts do not reach those altitudes when preparing to land or even after taking off.  Most airplanes I am familiar with never reach altitudes past 60,000 feet but the object had to have been up at least 100,000 feet.  The UFO appeared as a seemingly small, circular, reddish dot in the sky, it did not flash or glow.  It was traveling at relatively high speeds but that was the least interesting thing about it.  <BR><BR>After we stood watching it for almost a minute, I pulled out my phone in an attempt to get real footage of what we witnessed.  I had an iPhone 6s Plus and the quality of the camera along with the height of the UFO made it impossible to capture due to the time ! of night.  (This has made me into more of a believer than before knowing that even modern day technology is barely capable of capturing something so astonishingly high in the sky.)  It made no audible sounds possibly because of its altitude.  <BR><BR>We watched the object continue across the sky until we noticed another exactly similar one!  They were flying towards each other until they got very close to one another.  I knew this was beyond human capability, because one UFO (the second one to be spotted) came to an abrupt stop.  The UFO we originally seen continued on after they had crossed paths for approximately 5-10 seconds.  We watched in amazement and curiosity as the second UFO stopped moving as if it had spotted us!  It shot a white, star-colored dust into the air which dissipated very quickly, which after deep thought, we believe to be a thruster of some sort because the second UFO vanished moments later.  <BR><BR>In total, we witnessed about 2 minutes of seemingly unexplainable activity happening thousands of feet above us.  My only dream now is to make contact with those potential life forms as I find humans intolerant or ignorant to the concept of extraterrestrial life inhospitable.  Please do not take this as a joke, there is clear, consistent evidence of extraterritorial contact being covered up by governments around the world.  If there is any way I could assist the NUFORC or MUFON team in proving other-worldly existence, please reach out to me!</FONT></TD>"""

The night sky was crystal clear and even with the full moon, the stars were bright as ever.  Roughly 30 minutes into my moon watch, I noticed something &quot;gliding&quot; north to south fairly low overhead.  The light configuration was odd in that there two steady white lights spaced slightly apart with a third whitish-green light between them that seemed to pulse slightly somehow, as opposed to a blinking light on a standard aircraft.  In fact, there were no blinking lights anywhere on this object that I could see.  And it made no sound whatsoever.  <BR><BR>As I was watching this object move further south, two larger (or lower) orange round objects moving in tandem, each with what looked like yellow and orange light striations coming up from them at an angle, also slid by overhead moving north to south and completely silent.  The first object turned slightly south eastward and began to head slowly out over the ocean.  At this point, I was still trying to believe that this was an aircraft of some sort, but the object stopped suddenly out over the water and became fixed in the sky where it also appeared to progressively become brighter and brighter until I noticed what looked like colors mixing in with the original bright white light.  I just kept staring at this thing, trying to come up with a &quot;logical&quot; explanation for what it could be.<BR><BR>After 10 minutes or so, I took a chance and ran up to my house to grab my binoculars; I was afraid that the object would disappear if I took my eyes off of it.  But when I got back down to my bench, it was still there and I was able to see it clearly and with great detail through the binoculars.  I still can\\'t find the right words to describe the colors I saw on/in/around the object.  They possessed a brilliance and clarity and purity like I\\'ve never seen.  They were not flashing, but rather pulsating and shifting somehow.  Red, green, blue, white, violet...  There were no shafts or beams striking out from the object.  The colors were cohesive and unified, forming a fixed sphere.  The colors shifted and morphed across the object but I never saw them stay still.  Brilliant white light lines appeared interspersed the individual colors somehow, almost like borders but not really because it all pulsed at such a high rate that these white lines were never stationary.  At one point, the ! sphere seemed to elongate into a cylinder and then it returned to a sphere.<BR><BR>I called my husband, who was out of town, to describe to him in real time what I was looking at.  I also called my son, who lives a block away and asked him to come over to see what he thought about the odd thing.  We both watched it though binoculars for nearly an hour.  Eventually, the cold air off the water and the night moisture forced us indoors, but I went back out later to see if the object was still there...  It was gone. Neither of us have any idea what it was nor have we ever seen anything like it before.  Suffice it to say, it was spectacular.</FONT></TD>"""

My friends and I had all seen it, we are 100% positive it was not anything made by humans.  When we got to the part of road where it was surrounded by woods, we all heard a loud bang noise and could not see the flying saucer type object anymore.

Do not read past this if you are not prepared for you everything you know to change.<BR><BR>My friends and I moved towards where my friend thought he saw the saucer land.  We spent about 20 minutes looking until we found it.  The Saucer was about 10ft by 10ft and was like a Frisbee almost.  It landed in an awkward position, revealing kind of on its side.  We were all freaking out at this point and did not have any idea what we were looking at.  We spent only a short amount of time looking at the crashed saucer because a hatch opened at the bottom revealing a creature that was most definitely NOT HUMAN.  We all saw the creature or alien reveal itself and ran as fast as we possibly could.  We all got in my car and drove away talking about what we just saw.  We came to a consensus that the creature looked like Yoda from star wars just without the pointy ears.  I swear this is a true story and I have friends that saw the same thing as me.<BR><BR><BR>((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

As I was driving, in the corner of my eye, I saw a bright light speeding in a half circle, like it was changing directions.  I automatically looked out my window and noticed that it was much closer to the ground almost as far down as an airplane would go.

Wh! en the light turned green and I took my left turn the object started to move again at a steady pace toward Seattle, Washington (opposite direction of Issaquah).  <BR><BR>I decided to follow the object but it kept moving in random directions and I had to get to class so I turned my car around but when I looked in my rear view mirror the object was gone.

I looked out the window at the top of the stairs and saw a bright white light pulsating. I went to my room to get my binoculars.  I saw a round disk shape that I was thinking looked like a holographic form because of all the tiny white lights and connecting lines of white.  It was hovering over and began changing colors, red, green, white. I yelled for my daughter downstairs. She also viewed the object.  We then went outside in the front yard.  I looked through the binoculars while she was trying to take pictures and record off my phone.  The object was higher than a plane ( one of our videos has a plane flying underneath the obiect) and was higher than a cloud  , but not as high as a star or the moon.  We took turns looking.  I observed it changing shapes from circle to triangle.  It was moving up and down and would also go from side to side.  I would see it spilt and was describing as pie shapes, it would split ! and then pull back together as a solid circle shape.  We watched for about 45 mins and decided to go inside. I continued watching upstairs out the window where I originally saw it.  It continued doing the same actions but the shapes were changing into like a fish shape and what seemed like a cylinder shape.  The only thing I could see was lights connected by a white line, these are the shapes  I am describing.  I continued to watch from there until about 10:20 pm.  The object then zipped further away in the distance toward the south and out of my view.  I have a big window facing South and was able to view the object from there.  It was further away in the distance. I continued to watch the same patterns, but I was able to see a separate white light moving around the bigger circle, this light had even tinier white lights falling down from the sky.  I continued to watch till 12am when it was even further in distance and harder to see with the binoculars.<BR><BR>Daughter Cassie&#8217;s detailed description:  It was about 9pm on 1/8/2017 I was downstairs watching Tv.  My mom went upstairs for bed.  About 5 min later she&#8217;s yelling my name telling me to come upstairs.  She said she saw a ufo outside!  So I took a look in the binoculars and got focused on what she was looking at!  Once I did I saw a holographic diamond shape in the sky!  I looked around at all the other bright lights I saw in the sky of course because I was really wasn\\'t  believing what I was seeing!  Nothing else up there looked like this so We went outside to get a better look!  I watched and watched this thing for a good hr.! it was just hovering over one area until it disappeared and went to a new spot about 2 hrs later. While looking at this threw the binoculars I could see it rapidly changing colors. I&#8217;m not sure how else to describe it other than the colors just blended together &amp; you could see all of them at one time. It also kept changing shapes. I&#8217;m not sure if it was turning and I was just seeing a different side of it or if it was actually changing the shape of its self. I did see something open up from the bottom and a bright ray of purple light came out of the bottom of it! It did not last long though I would say it was there for what felt about a minute then the purple slowly disappeared. When looking at this threw the binoculars I did get a little freaked out &amp; thought something was watching me so I felt I needed to stop looking. When looking at this with your naked eye it was just a really bright ! light. While recording it on the phone with no flash on it was a bright light that quickly moved from one spot to another without any explanation. I have never seen anything like this before! it was absolutely amazing to see! At one point an airplane flew by and this object was above the plane level but below the stars! I later looked up imagines of a satellite &amp; this object looked nothing like any satellite!</FONT></TD>"""

It was like nothing I&#8217;ve ever heard before.  It moved north away from the house and sounded like it was moving back and forth between the northern and western part of Golden.  I woke up my girlfriend and she was able to hear it to, but couldn&#8217;t make sense of it either.<BR><BR>&#9;Checked around while it was going on and the sound didn&#8217;t appear to be created by the borderline record setting winds blowing through or against anything as the noise remained consistent in volume between wind gusts.  Also, being from Wyoming (arguably the windiest state in the country) and having heard a lot of wind against a lot of different things, this hum was still like nothing I&#8217;ve heard before.  I checked the skies around the house, but it was overcast and all I could see was the glow of the Denver lights bouncing off of the cloud deck.  But considering the fight or flight response that sound was eliciting from me, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t see anything if I&#8217;m honest.  My every instinct was telling me to get as far away as fast as possible.  It&#8217;s worth noting that the hum was higher pitched and seemed to alternate between 2 tones.  It scared the hell out of me but oddly the sound was kind of pretty in a way.  I&#8217;ve found a lot of reports online of a &#8220;hum&#8221; that detailed a really low pitch that almost chimes, but this was nothing like that and was both several octaves higher and constant.<BR><BR>&#9;Also conferred with my next door neighbors.  They woke up from the wind at about the same time that I did and also heard the noise, but they&#8217;re pretty heavy sleepers and fell back asleep pretty quickly without giving it much attention.  To be more specific, it didn&#8217;t occur to them that they heard a sound until I brought it up a few days later.  I stayed up and listened to the hum until about 5:30am before falling back asleep myself.  As far as I can tell, no one has reported this to anyone.<BR><BR>&#9;I&#8217;m prior military and a fairly level headed person.

Emerging out from the palm tree branches was this triangle.  It seemed like it was not that high (in our skies/atmosphere like any other pane would be...but this was no plane)  It was 4-5 times as big as any plane I have seen flying over me and I am 51 years old.  It was completely silent and I was looking up a little to the coast but almost over my neighboring suburb.  It was not like it was far away and just a dot or fast squiggle, this was a triangular aircraft that flew smoothly and silently in a straight line down our coast/over land coast side of Perth city. <BR><BR>This aircraft operated on a completely level than anything I have seen before.  IF it was a government aircraft, that scares me more than if it was extraterrestrial.  I watched it from the top of my driveway through the sky southward until it was too small to see (on the horizon that you can see over the house across the road, quite a long way) and it traveled that in about 10 or so seconds.  I had a good 3-5 second look at this thing and I am still awestruck.  I have contacted channels 7, 9, 10, 2, The West Australian, Perth Now, Perth Observatory, Australian Weathercams and no-one has got back to me.  Perth weather gave me some sites to look at but they only have a pic each min and timelapse shows those pics only.  I need footage of Perth skies coast side of Perth on the 8th January 2017 and to sit in front of the screen and watch between 2.25am and 2.30am focusing in at 2.28. So frustrating because I am not some crazy and I know what I saw which was flying, was definately some kind of object/craft and I could not identify it.</FONT></TD>'"

Other times have been in the early morning around 0700.  The object has been in trees then down the middle of the road.  On January 07th 2017 he noticed it through the trees.  But you would lose sight of it like the trees where blowing in the wind.  You would wait for the trees to move to see it again but you couldn\\'t you would have to move slightly to see it.  It was a very bright flickering light that seemed to glow and flicker.  I got in my vehicle with my two kids to get a better look.  When we started to video it with a video camera it was a white diamond shape which we caught on tape.  It changed to a circle with lights changing on it. The outside was a green with the middle being red.  As we recorded it I had the camera on full zoom without touching the video camera it would come in and out of range.  Towards the end of taping the object wouldn\\'t allow me to get a steady view of it when before we taped it with no problem with it moving.  We have this all on video.  We decided to get closer. As we went closer it seemed to go farther away.  By the time we got to a small town near us we couldn\\'t find it.  We went to the west of the town (we had come in from the east) we could no longer find the object in the sky.  We went back towards our home, to the east, then we could see the object again out in the far distance to the west.  The object moved to the north about 4 miles and to the west farther.  We tried to get close to it in our vehicle but it was too far away to catch. I called the UFO hot line you told me it was Venus.  I looked online today on 01/08/2017 and it looks just like the orbs that people are reporting and video taping.

There were two large objects about 200 yards apart with approximately 7 to 10 objects in between these 2 large objects. It looked like these objects were swarming in between these 2 large brightly lit objects like bees swarming around a hive.  All of these lights looked the same except they varied in brightness.  These objects looked like they wanted to be seen and were totally cluttering up this small area with no attempt to cloak themselves or become dimmer.  This concerned neighbor and I were looking at this object on the far left of this formation for 10 to 15 minutes and could not make out any specific shape to it, except to say that it had streams of light coming of it, and that it looked like an oblong &quot;lava lamp&quot;.   <BR><BR>Finally this object on the left began to strobe or blink and started heading southwest toward Mt.
