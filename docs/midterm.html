      <h2><b>Data Analysis</b></h2>
      <p>
         We collect UFO reports data from website http://www.nuforc.org/, GIS data from Google’s API https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/ and weather data from https://darksky.net/.
      </p>
      <p>
        After data cleaning, UFO reports data has eight columns: event_id, time, city, state, shape, duration, summary and location_id. Here’s a glimpse of our UFO reports data stored as CSV file:

      </p>
      <p>
        GIS data has five columns: location_id, city, state, lat and lng. Here’s a glimpse of our GIS data stored as CSV file:
      </p>
      <p>
        Weather data has eleven columns: event_id, summary, icon, temperature, apparentTemp, dewPoint, humidity, windSpeed, windBearing, visibility and pressure. Here’s a glimpse of our weather data stored as CSV file:
      </p>
      <p>
        For the convenience of data analyzing, we create a relational database “my_ufo.db” which has two tables “events” and “weathers”. Here’s the schema of the two tables:
<pre>
  events(event_id:int, year:int, month:int, day:int, time:text, city:text, state:text, shape:text, duration:text, summary:text, lat:float, lng:float)
  
  weathers(event_id:int, summary:text, icon:text, temperature:float, apparentTemperature:float, dewPoint:float, humidity:float, windSpeed:float, windBearing:int, visibility:float, pressure:float)
</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are investigating into the relationship of UFOs features or characteristics with corresponding weather or GIS information and probably predicting the occurrence of UFO at certain location and time. Thus we make use of Google heat map to show the distribution of UFO witnesses of a certain year. For example below is a heat map of UFO reports across United States in 2016:

      <h2><b>Discussion</b></h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We think that data collecting and leaning is the hardest part we’ve encountered so far, because it’s sometimes very difficult to find the data we need to further analyze.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our hypothesis is that the probability of UFO events’ appearance is much higher where altitude is high and when humidity is high.
          </li>
          <li>
            We find that the west and east coast of United States are locations where UFO witnesses occurred the most. And maybe it has something to do with local geography and weather condition.
          </li>
          <li>
            Moving forward, we think the biggest problems are using machine-learning to train our data, figure out patterns and correlation between UFO witness with GIS and weather at that time.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Given our initial exploration of the data, we think we are on track with our project and it’s worth proceeding with our project.
          </li>
        </ul>
