for machine learning:

maybe we can use density estimation to do some nonparametric estimation? 
one thing I still can't figure out is why svm--numeric features can have such a great classification result? doesn't make sense.... And if this is true, actually I don't need to think about nonparametric estimation any more..

above solved

for web app:

add detialed description of why we give a certain classification to users, like forms, charts, probabilities
draw corresponding D3 chart
send json from python to web

above solved

update database

sbove solved by python, all back-end work should be done by python if possible. Also, to facilitate the front-end, the code
first print out predict result, then update database
